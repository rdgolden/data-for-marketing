* Today we will be learning how to apply some of our newfound data analysis and visualization skills to drive forward business solutions.
​
* This webinar will primarily focus on how we can use data to support a marketing team.
​
* It is highly likely that when students interview for data positions, that they will be asked to develop highly practical and on-the-fly solutions to very real business problems.
​
* The ability to break down business problems into valuable data questions and apply technical skills to develop solutions will be the key to a successful interview and a new career. That's what we will be focusing on today.

### 2. Understanding Marketing (10 mins)

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 5: Marketing Vocabulary</strong></summary>

* In order for students to fully grasp the concepts covered in today's lecture, they need to understand the lingo used by today’s marketing department Data Analysts.

* Share [marketing_vocab.pdf](./marketing_vocab.pdf) with class as reference material. Open link and choose and few important keywords to highlight. Students should have received a link to this material on the webinar invitation.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 6: Why is Data Analytics Important for Marketing?</strong></summary>

* It can be argued that solid marketing is the one of the most important factors in determining whether or not a business will succeed.

* Leaders in every organization are vying for data analysts that can help their marketing departments understand the habits and interests of their target demographics, predict trends, and help direct their resources in the most efficient ways.

* Marketing departments buy ads, write copy, bid on keywords, organize events, and identify target demographics for their products. They need reliable data to make well-informed decisions.

* In other words, marketing is responsible for engagement strategies and maintainining relationships with their audience to ensure the business stays viable, but they can't do this without data.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 7: What is Data Driven Marketing?</strong></summary>

* Data-Driven Marketing (DDM) uses available data to gain industry and performance insights, in turn allowing the business to make more informed marketing decisions. It's using what the students know, as data analysts, to keep the business in competition.
​
* Run class through the four-part marketing process listed in the chart and ask students to raise their hands if they can relate this process to the processes that they covered in class.
​
* Use the following as some potential examples of marketing problems that require data-driven solutions:

  * "Some of our KPIs seems to be decreasing, could you help us determine what may be leading to this sudden decline in performance?"

  * "Could you gather data to help us determine which marketing efforts are driving the highest amount of conversions?"
​
* Make sure to highlight this potential issue, as it will be followed up in the next section:
​
  * “Our CPA is pretty high and we want to invest in clients with the highest Lifetime value. Can you help us?”

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 8: Data Driven Marketing Gets Results</strong></summary>

* Data-driven Marketing has completely reshaped the way that companies engage with customers, design marketing campaigns, and determine which assets are critical and worth continuing to expense. Data Analytics in Marketing has become absolutely necessary.
​
  * Explain that DDM has been shown to improve efficiency, engagement, and performance when applied to marketing strategy.

* There are many inspiring statistics to vouch for the relevance and importance of DDM. A few key ones to highlight:

  * Companies that utilize DDM are 6 times more likely to be profitable
  * Businesses with data-driven strategies have five to eight times as much ROI
  * 40% of brands plan to expand their DDM budgets
  * Marketers that exceeded revenue goals used Data Driven Personalization 83% of the time
  * 64% of marketing executives "strongly agree" that DDM is crucial to business

### 3. Applying Data Analytics (10 mins)

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 9: First Steps Toward a Data Driven Solution</strong></summary>

* Introduce this activity to the students and let them know everyone will work together to apply Data Analytics to this interview question demonstrating a real world business problem.

* Remind students that LTV stands for Lifetime Value, meaning how much money the company will make from one customer over the course of their entire relationship.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 10: Redefine the Issue in Data Terms</strong></summary>

* The first step in solving any problem is to rephrase it in terminology that works for the data team. Take this example question from earlier for example:

  * “Our CPA is pretty high and we want to only invest in clients with the highest LTV. Can you help us?”

* Remove all irrelevant content to increase focus on strictly the data that needs to be gathered.

* How could this question be re-phrased in data terms?

  * “What traits do customers with high LTV share?”

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 11: Acquire the Data</strong></summary>

* The best place to start in this case is probably to ask your stakeholder where and how they store their data.

  * Let's imagine for this example that they use SalesForce. Many companies don't grant Salesforce API access to everyone, so you may not be able to access it directly.

  * No problem! You'd ask them run a fresh report and send over a <code>.csv</code> file.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 12: Pull Data into Jupyter Notebook</strong></summary>

* Slack out link to code folder so students can follow along!

* Explain the first two blocks of Python code, which are used to import dependencies and bring in the CSV file.

* Mention that typically, this is where data cleaning would occur, but for the sake of brevity imagine that we were given a relatively small, clean dataset by our stakeholder.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 13: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong></summary>

* The goal is to plot the data and analyze LTV against each other non-categorical factor listed in the CSV.
​
  * Then use regression analysis to look for the strongest correlations between various criteria and CLTV.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 14: Linear Regression</strong></summary>

* Next, perform linear regression using LTV vs FPV, and create an equation for the line. Then, plot this linear model over the scatter plot.

* Now repeat this same process of plotting scatter and linear model for LTV against all other non-categorical data.

</details>

### 4. Presenting Our Findings (5 mins)

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slides 15-18: LTV Correlations</strong></summary>

* Run through each slide and explain how each category correlates with our LTV values.

* **Lifetime Value vs First Purchase Value** - Appear to have no strong relationship. However, the data shows that people with very high FPVs tend to make one time purchases only. Perhaps shopping sprees?

* **Lifetime Value vs Age** - Have no linear relationship. However, this chart does reveal that our customers with the highest LTVs tend to be in their 30s and 40s.

* **Lifetime Value vs Household Income** - High household income has a very clear direct correlation to the lifetime value of customers. People who make 100k or more tend to have a Lifetime Value of 5,000 or more.

* **Lifetime Value vs Personal Income** - Interesting cluster of high LTV around the lowest Personal Income on the left, and on the right we have a steady increase as Personal Income increases. This is an opportunity to infer that our target demographic is people with a high household income and a low personal income, likely people who are not the primary breadwinners.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 19: Present Findings to Stakeholders</strong></summary>

* Make it the goal to always exceed employer expectations and go the extra step.
​
  * Perhaps, during analysis, extraneous information is revealed that you know could be highly valuable to your company. Don't hesitate to include it just because it isn't specific to the problem being solved! This is part of going the extra step to ensure client success.

* From our analysis today, we can determine the following key findings:
  * The highest LTV age range is 30s-40s.
  * Household Income is our clearest indicator of LTV, however personal income tends to be lower.

* Using this info, we can infer that our target marketing demographic is non-employed or under-employed spouses in high-income households.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Slide 20: Student Questions and End Lecture</strong></summary>

* Take one more "Fist-to-Five" of the class to see how they feel about the material that you just went over.

* Allow them the opportunity to ask any lingering questions that they may have. If you know that it will take a lengthy response or a group search to find an answer for a student, refer the student to office hours and move along.

* If you have time remaining and students are not asking questions, try engaging them with questions such as:

  * What other methods could we potentially use to analyze this Data set, and what sort of information would we hope to gather from each?

  * What are some potential challenges that you foresee in dealing with marketing departments or meeting marketing needs as a Data Analyst?

* Thank the class for their time and participation, and ask them to fill out the feedback form that you will be Slacking out if they get a chance.
